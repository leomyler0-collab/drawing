console.log('System Status:');
console.log('  Users:', users.length);
console.log('  Drawings:', drawings.length);
console.log('  Public:', drawings.filter(d => d.isPublic).length);

// Should show real users, not demo users
console.log('Users:', users.map(u => u.username));
```

### **Verify Production Mode:**
