# 🎉 Account Creation System - Complete Guide

## ✅ VIP Accounts Are Now Pre-Loaded!

Your VIP accounts are **automatically created** when the server starts - just like the admin account!

### 👑 Pre-Loaded VIP Accounts

These accounts are ready immediately after deployment:

| Account | Email | Password | Tier | Avatar |
|---------|-------|----------|------|--------|
| **Janet** | ronet@gmail.com | janet | VIP | 👑 |
| **Nicky23** | nicky23@gmail.com | maina | VIP | 💎 |

**No manual setup required!** Just start your server and these accounts exist.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. ✅ Admin account auto-created (if not exists)
2. ✅ VIP accounts auto-created (if not exist)
